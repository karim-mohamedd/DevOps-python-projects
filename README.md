Here is a **clean, simple, professional** README for your **Python DevSecOps Projects** repository.
It doesn’t go into too much detail (because each project will have its own README).
It also includes your contribution with your friend **Ahmed Abdelhakim (ahmedabdelhakim13)**.

# 🛡️ Python Projects for DevSecOps

This repository contains a collection of Python projects focused on **DevOps**, **Security**, and **Automation** practices.
Each project demonstrates a key concept in DevSecOps such as monitoring, CI/CD automation, system auditing, backup management, and secure operations.

These projects were developed collaboratively by **Karim Elwaraky** and **Ahmed Abdelhakim**
(GitHub: **[@ahmedabdelhakim13](https://github.com/ahmedabdelhakim13)**).

## 📦 Included Projects

### **🔹 Project 1: Remote Server Health Dashboard**

A Python script that connects to multiple Linux servers using `paramiko` to collect system metrics.
It gathers remote information, saves results in JSON/CSV, logs connection activity, and can optionally visualize trends.

---

### **🔹 Project 2: Mini CI/CD Pipeline Simulator**

A lightweight CI/CD simulation that runs unit tests, packages the project, calculates SHA256 hash, moves the package to a deployment folder, and logs all steps.
Optional notification support is included.

---

### **🔹 Project 3: Scheduled Backup and Monitoring Agent**

A local monitoring script that watches a directory using `watchdog`, automatically backs up modified files, and logs all activity.
Optional email/webhook notification support is available.

---

### **🔹 Project 4: Automated System Audit and Backup Tool**

A daily system automation tool that collects CPU, memory, and disk usage, stores results with timestamps, archives logs, and keeps only the last seven days of data.
Optional log encryption is supported.
